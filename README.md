### Summary
Business communities in the United States are facing high demand for human resources, but one of the constant challenges is identifying and attracting the right talent, which is perhaps the most important element in remaining competitive. Companies in the United States look for hard-working, talented, and qualified individuals both locally as well as abroad.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US permits foreign workers to come to the United States to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against adverse impacts on their wages or working conditions by ensuring US employers' compliance with statutory requirements when they hire foreign workers to fill workforce shortages. The immigration programs are administered by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).

OFLC processes job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications in those cases where employers can demonstrate that there are not sufficient US workers available to perform the work at wages that meet or exceed the wage paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment.

### Actionable Insights and Recommendations
The best-performing model ranks the following characteristics of the applicant's profile:
  - A higher education than a High School degree. The optimal candidate is a Master's degree holder
  - The applicant should have work experience.
  - A high wage offered to the applicant.
  - The applicant has a full-time employment contract.
  - From the same model, an organisation is more likely to recruit successfully if they:
 - They are offering a high-wage
 - Are a large organisation with a large workforce<br/>
 
With the help of the visualisations of the data, process efficiency should focus on improving the following pipelines
- Asia. They form the highest contributors of applicants.
- To the Iskands. The islands are offering the highest wages for foreigners and those accepetd. The region has the lowest levels of education in the dataset.
